VERIFICATION OF PROCESS_INFO STRUCT

1. SystemMonitor/ProcessView.h (Definition):
struct ProcessInfo {
    team_id id;
    char name[B_OS_NAME_LENGTH];
    char userName[B_OS_NAME_LENGTH];
    char args[64];
    ProcessState state;  // <--- ALREADY AN ENUM
    uint32 threadCount;
    // ...
};

2. SystemMonitor/ProcessView.cpp (Assignment in UpdateThread):
   if (isRunning) currentProc.state = PROCESS_STATE_RUNNING;
   else if (isReady) currentProc.state = PROCESS_STATE_READY;
   else currentProc.state = PROCESS_STATE_SLEEPING;

The review claiming "state is char*" is incorrect. The struct was already updated in a previous commit or the original issue description was outdated regarding the struct's content.

This patch optimizes ProcessListItem::Update to USE this existing enum for comparison instead of the redundant string comparison.
